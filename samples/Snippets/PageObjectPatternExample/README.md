# Overview

The code included here will not compile on its own. The code here represents an example set of pages from a Page Object Pattern test suite. Note that these pages are tailored for a specific application (code for that app is not contained in this repository), and are represented here only as a general overview of how Page Object Pattern testing might work in C#.
